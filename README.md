# Geek's Den: Ruby on Rails Capstone

> Geek's Den is an entertainment news website created using Ruby on Rails, based on the design idea by Nelson Sakwa on Behance (https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version) .


## Main Features

* It allows the users to register and login using only a username.

* Then they can start populating the website with articles of their creation. 

* The articles need a Title, a content or body, a picture and a corresponding category, selected through a select-box.

* The home webpage shows the latest articles by categories and full-width promo of the featured article. This featured achievement is accomplished if the article is the most voted. 

* When a user clicks on a category, all the articles associated are shown.

* If a user wants to see the articles of his creation, he can go to his user page by clicking his name on the nav bar.
